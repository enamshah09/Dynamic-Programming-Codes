/**
 * Egg Dropping Problem
 * 
 * You are given m eggs, and access to a n-storey building.
 * 
 * The aim is to find out the highest floor from which an egg will not break when dropped out of a window from that floor.
 * If an egg is dropped and does not break, it is undamaged and can be dropped again.
 * However, once an egg is broken, thatâ€™s it for that egg.
 * 
 * If an egg breaks when dropped from floor j, then it would also have broken from any floor above that.
 * If an egg survives a fall, then it will survive any fall shorter than that.
 * 
 * The question is: What strategy should you adopt to minimize the number egg drops it takes to find the solution?
